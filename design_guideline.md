# Design plan

## Colors

More pastel colors, not too flashy

**Primary color: ** Green
**Secondary color: ** Blue

## Typography

Sans-serif fonts, decently sized. All united sizes - every page uses the same font sizes.

**Headings:**  Raleway
**Texts:**  Roboto

## Layout

**Main incentive:**  A big button to start playing the game in the dashboard. At first though the main incentive will be to sign up/log in.

**Hierarchy:**  Dashboard, the game itself, profiles, challenges - everything will be accessible from the main menu at the bottom of the screen.

## Icons

Material UI icons to keep it simple.

## Border rounding

Decently rounded - the app should be friendly, inviting and intriguing.

## Shadows

A bit of backdrop shadows for buttons, top-bars, etc. to add depth and make them stand out more
